        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <div class="start">
       I'll Start By Talking About How I Got To Where I Am,So I Finished My Studies In 
       The Middle East Due To Fathers Profession,I Never Knew Much About Tech As I Didn't 
       Really Understand How Tech Was Used Due To Limited Resorces And Education.
       I Pretty Much Had Everything Planned Out By My Father, He Decided For Me To Become A 
       Doctor Like Himself.I Didn't Really Know What I Wanted To Do So I Decided To Go Ahead With
       It.Sometime Later When I Got The Admission And It Was Close By That I Had To Leave To Study.
       I Felt A Strong Feeling Of Dissatisfaction.I Couldn't See Myself In The Next 6 Years As A 
       Doctor, It Just Wasn't Me.I Explained It To My Father And He Understood My Decision As I 
       Didn't Have Much Interest For It. I Didn't Know What I Wanted To Do, Tech Always Seemed Very Interesting
       However It Was Very Complex To Understand At The Start.Coding Seemed Amazing 
        As I Could Visualise Something And Code It.I Watched Many Tutorials And Hired An
       Online Teacher To Help Me Understand Coding As It Was Something I Wanted To Get In To.
       It Was Very Tough At The Beginning However I Was Practicing And Was Absolutely Hooked On To
       Freecodecamp And I Tried A Little Bit Of Codewars Also.Although I Was Moving At A Slow Pace
       I Was Enjoying Every Moment And Knew That This Is What I Want To Do In Life.I Came Back To The UK
       And Attended Quite A Few Tech Events, I Was Introduced To A Dev From Codenation(Bootcamp In Manchester)
       I Came In And Fell In Love With The Atmosphere,People And The Resorces Available.I Did Many
       Projects And Developed Many Of My Skills And Abilities.
